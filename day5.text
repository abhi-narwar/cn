1. What happens when you enter google.com in a web browser?
The browser first checks its cache for the website content. If itâ€™s available and fresh, it displays it immediately.

If not, it checks the cache for the IP address of the URL. If not found, it asks the OS to perform a DNS lookup using UDP to find the IP address from a DNS server.

Once the IP is found, a TCP connection is established with the server via a three-way handshake.

The browser sends an HTTP request to the server.

The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response.

The browser processes the response, caches the data if allowed, and renders the content.

The TCP connection can be closed or reused for further requests.



2. Hub vs Switch
Hub operates at the Physical layer. It broadcasts incoming signals to all ports except the source. No packet filtering; works in half-duplex mode.

Switch operates at the Data Link layer. It connects devices and filters traffic based on MAC addresses, enabling full-duplex communication. More efficient than a hub.


3. Subnetting
Subnetting divides a large network into smaller subnetworks (subnets).

It improves routing efficiency, enhances security, and reduces the time needed to find host addresses in routing tables.



4. Network Reliability Factors
Downtime: Time taken to recover from failures.

Failure Frequency: How often the network fails.

Catastrophe: Unexpected disasters like fire or earthquakes affecting the network.


5. Criteria for Effective Networks
Performance: Measures like transmission time and response time.

Reliability: How often the network fails.

Robustness: Strength and stability of the network.

Security: Protecting data from unauthorized access and viruses.

6. Node and Link
Node: A device like a computer connected to a network.

Link: The physical medium (like cable or fiber optics) connecting the nodes.

7. Gateway vs Router
Both connect networks and forward data.

Router: Forwards data between similar networks.

Gateway: Connects and translates between different types of networks.


8. NIC (Network Interface Card)
A hardware component that connects a computer to a network.

Each NIC has a unique MAC address.

Mostly used in desktops for wired or wireless connections.



9. POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)
Used for accessing mail on a client machine.

Supports two modes:

Delete Mode: Deletes email from the server after download.

Keep Mode: Keeps a copy of emails on the server.
