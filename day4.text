What is a Protocol?
A protocol is a set of rules that controls how data is communicated between devices. It includes:

Syntax: How data is structured or formatted.

Semantics: The meaning of each part of the data.

Timing: When data should be sent and how fast.




Key Protocols:
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):
DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses and other network settings to devices in a network so they can communicate easily. It works on port 67 and simplifies network management.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol):
FTP helps transfer files between computers over a network. It’s commonly used to download files from servers. FTP uses port 27 by default.

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):
ICMP helps in error reporting and diagnosing network problems. For example, it is used by routers to check if data is reaching its destination correctly. It uses port 7.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):
ARP converts logical IP addresses into physical MAC addresses, which are needed to send data within a local network. It helps devices find each other on the same network.

RIP (Routing Information Protocol):
RIP is used by routers to find the best path to send data from one network to another using the hop count method. It is suited for small or medium-sized networks.

Bonus Tip for Interview:
If asked why protocols are important, you can say:
“Protocols are important because they make sure all devices understand each other, sending and receiving data correctly and efficiently.”



MAC Address and IP Address – Interview Answer

MAC Address (Media Access Control Address):

It is a unique physical address assigned to a device’s network interface card (NIC) by the manufacturer.

It identifies the device on the local network physically.

IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):

It is assigned by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) or network administrator.

It identifies the device’s connection on a network, allowing it to communicate over the internet or other networks.

Main difference:

MAC address uniquely identifies the device itself (hardware level).

IP address uniquely identifies the device’s network location or connection.



Ipconfig and Ifconfig
Ipconfig (Internet Protocol Configuration) is a command used in Microsoft Windows operating systems to view and configure network interface settings such as IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.

Ifconfig (Interface Configuration) is a similar command used in Linux, Mac, and UNIX systems for viewing and configuring network interfaces.


Firewall
A firewall is a network security system that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and blocks or allows data based on a set of security rules or policies.

It acts as a protective barrier between a public network (like the internet) and a private network (like your home or office network).

Firewalls can be hardware devices, software programs, or a combination of both, providing an important layer of security by preventing unauthorized access.
