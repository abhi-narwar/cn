‚úÖ 1. What is a Network?
Interview Answer:

A network is a group of connected devices that can share data with each other using a communication link. These devices, also called nodes, are connected either directly or indirectly to exchange data and resources like files, printers, etc.

Tip: Keep it short and add an example.
Example: "For example, when we connect our computer and mobile to the same Wi-Fi, it creates a small network."


‚úÖ 2. What is Network Topology?
Interview Answer:

Network topology is the physical layout of devices in a network. It shows how computers and cables are arranged and connected.



‚úÖ Types of Network Topologies (with Simple Interview Points):
‚≠ê Star Topology
In star topology, all devices are connected to a central device like a switch or hub.
Advantage: Easy to manage and troubleshoot.
Disadvantage: If the central device fails, the whole network goes down.
Used in: Offices, homes.

üîÑ Ring Topology
In ring topology, each device connects to two others, forming a loop.
Advantage: No need for central device.
Disadvantage: Failure of one node affects the whole network.
Used in: Rare, but used in SONET, SDH.

üöç Bus Topology
All devices are connected to a single central cable (bus).
Advantage: Simple and cheap.
Disadvantage: If the bus cable breaks, entire network fails.
Used in: Small networks.

üï∏Ô∏è Mesh Topology
In mesh topology, every device is connected to every other device.
Advantage: Very reliable.
Disadvantage: High cost and difficult to install.
Used in: Military, critical systems.

üå≤ Tree Topology
It is a mix of star and bus topology. Groups of star topologies are connected to a main bus.
Used in: Large organizations.

üß© Hybrid Topology
It combines two or more different topologies.
Advantage: Flexible and scalable.
Used in: Big enterprise networks.

‚úÖ 4. What is VPN (Virtual Private Network)?
Interview Answer:

VPN is a private and secure network created over the public internet. It helps users connect to a company's network securely from remote locations.

Advantages (in short):

Secure data transfer

Remote access to office networks

Protects online identity

Encrypts internet traffic

Types of VPN:

Access VPN: For individual remote users.

Site-to-Site VPN: For connecting two office branches.

Intranet VPN: Internal company use

Extranet VPN: Connect with partners/suppliers securely




‚úÖ 5. What is IPv4?
Interview Answer:

IPv4 is a 32-bit address used to identify devices on a network. It has 4 parts (octets) separated by dots. Each part can have a value between 0 to 255.

Example: 192.168.0.1
Classes of IPv4:

| Class | Range                       | Use                   |
| ----- | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| A     | 1.0.0.0 ‚Äì 126.255.255.255   | Large networks        |
| B     | 128.0.0.0 ‚Äì 191.255.255.255 | Medium networks       |
