üîπ What is the OSI Model?
Answer:

The OSI model stands for Open Systems Interconnection.
It is a conceptual framework that standardizes how data travels through a network in seven layers, from the sender to the receiver.
Each layer has a specific role and helps different systems communicate efficiently.



üîπ Why is the OSI Model important?
Answer:

It helps different hardware and software systems to communicate using standard protocols.
It also makes network design, troubleshooting, and development easier and modular by dividing it into layers.


üîπ Can you name and explain the 7 layers of the OSI Model?
Answer:

Yes, the 7 layers of OSI model from bottom to top are:



1Ô∏è‚É£ Physical Layer
Deals with the actual physical connection (cables, signals, voltage).

It transmits raw bits (0s and 1s) over the medium.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Link Layer
Converts bits into frames and adds MAC addresses.

Handles error detection, flow control, and link management.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Network Layer
Responsible for routing the data using IP addresses.

Finds the best path for packet delivery.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Transport Layer
Ensures error-free, reliable delivery of messages.

Supports both connection-oriented (TCP) and connectionless (UDP) communication.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Session Layer
Manages the start, control, and end of communication sessions.

Maintains sessions between devices.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Presentation Layer
Translates, compresses, and encrypts data.

Converts data into a format understandable by the application layer.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Application Layer
Closest to the user.

Provides services like email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP), web (HTTP).
